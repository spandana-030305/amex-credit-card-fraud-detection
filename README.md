This project focuses on predicting credit card defaulters using American Express(AMEX) dataset.

# Dataset Preparation:
** Original Dataset **: The original dataset was a 16.4 GB CSV file.
** Conversion **: The CSV file was converted into a 4.7 GB Parquet file for optimized performance.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA was conducted to gain insights. This includes:
Distribution analysis of variables
Analysis of missing values and implementation of imputation strategies
Correlation checks(high correlation and low correlation) were performed to reduce redundancy

# Current Status:
Dataset loading and conversion
Completed initital EDA
** Next Step **: Flattening the dataset and model development

# Next Steps:
Flattening the dataset for model implementation
Implementing baseline machine learning model(Perpetual Booster(a GBM algorithm))
Evaluating models using various evaluation metrics
Deploying the trained model for real-time fraud detection
