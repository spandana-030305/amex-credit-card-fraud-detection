This project focuses on predicting credit card defaulters using American Express(AMEX) dataset.

# Dataset Preparation:
- **Original Dataset**: The original dataset was a 16.4 GB CSV file.
- **Conversion**: The CSV file was converted into a 4.7 GB Parquet file for optimized performance.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA was conducted to gain insights. This includes:
- Distribution analysis of variables
- Analysis of missing values and implementation of imputation strategies
- Correlation checks(high correlation and low correlation) were performed to reduce redundancy

# Current Status:
- Dataset loading and conversion
- Completed initital EDA
- Flattened the dataset
- **Next Step**: Model development

# Next Steps:
- Implementing baseline machine learning model(Perpetual Booster(a GBM algorithm))
- Evaluating models using various evaluation metrics
- Deploying the trained model for real-time fraud detection
